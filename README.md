<h1>Random Forest - Accuracy Score</h1>

<div>
  <p>This program shows a graph about the accuracy score of the Random Forest algorithm.</p>
  <p>For more informations about the algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest</p>
  <p>In a nutshell, this algorithm uses multiples Decision trees for classification task, and it is possible to define the number of trees that the algorithm will use for training and predictions. But there is no rule of how many trees to use in a specif problem. So that's why the programmer needs to test and see the accuracy score of different numbers of trees to choose the best option.</p>
  <p>So with that in mind, I created this program to graphically show the accuracy score of different numbers of trees used in the Random Forest. I used an already created data base to exemplify (15% of the data base was used to training section, and the rest was used for testing), and the goal was to classify the income of different clients.</p>
  <p>When you execute the program, you need to input the number of trees you want to test and, before that, it will show a graph with all accuracy scores of the process. And you can draw conclusions about the Random Forest algorithm...</p>
